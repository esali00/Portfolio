                <p>I am a 22-year old Frontend Developer based in Munich, Germany. Through studying Business Informatics i came in touch with programming and learned many languages like Python, Java and JavaScript.
                    But i liked JavaScript (Frontend Development) the most out of all. That's why i wanted to gain much more experience and joined Developer Akademie to realize more projects and to eventually land a job as Frontend Developer in the future.
                    I am always ready to learn new technologies and hope to gain even more experience with much larger projects.
